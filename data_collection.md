The Aquatic Life Foundation project (AqQua) aims to compile multimodal image datasets from contributing Helmholtz Centres, national and international partners to train a unified, accessible plankton image recognition model to help monitor and understand the health of our oceans. Vast contributions from the global community will complement data originating from Helmholtz centers and diverse, multimodal composition of the training data will ensure generalizability and performance of the AqQua Foundation Model.
